# CShard
Reimplementation in C++ of the closed source Shard engine for the course Introduction To Game Engine Architecture

# How to use

First thing to do is to download the code:
```
git clone https://github.com/AsperTheDog/CShard --recursive
```
Notice the `--recursive`. This is important, that way all of the necessary dependencies are properly downloaded.  
In the CShard folder you will find the solution file. The first time building glew will have to download a lot of dependencies and build many files. It will take time but that only has to be done once.

# Prerequisites

The system needs a GPU capable of running OpenGL 4.6
